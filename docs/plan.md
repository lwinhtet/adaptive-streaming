Building a video streaming platform like Facebook involves several steps in the backend for video upload, storage, processing, and retrieval. Here's a simplified overview of the process, along with considerations for caching:

Video Upload:
Receive Video File:

When a user uploads a video, your backend server should receive the video file. This is typically done through an HTTP POST request.
File Storage:

Store the video file in a storage system (e.g., Amazon S3, Google Cloud Storage) designed for efficient and scalable file storage.
Metadata Storage:

Store metadata related to the video, such as title, description, uploader information, and any other relevant details, in a database.
Encoding and Transcoding:

Perform video encoding and transcoding to generate different quality versions of the video. This is crucial for adaptive streaming.
Create Thumbnails:

Generate thumbnails for preview images or video previews. Thumbnails are often pre-generated and stored for quick retrieval.
Update Database:

Update the database with the necessary information about the video, including file paths, encoding details, and thumbnail paths.
Video Retrieval:
User Requests Video:

When a user requests a video, the backend receives a request, typically through an HTTP GET request.
Check Cache:

Check if the requested video or its metadata is available in the cache. Caches can be used to store frequently accessed videos or metadata, reducing the load on the database.
Retrieve Metadata:

If available in the cache, retrieve the video metadata. If not, fetch it from the database.
Adaptive Streaming:

Determine the appropriate quality version of the video based on the user's device and network conditions. Deliver the video using adaptive streaming protocols like DASH or HLS.
Deliver Video Content:

Stream the video content to the user's device. This involves delivering chunks of the video in response to the user's playback requests.
Caching Considerations:
Metadata Cache: Cache video metadata to reduce database queries for frequently accessed information.

CDN (Content Delivery Network): Use a CDN to cache and deliver video content closer to users, reducing latency and improving performance.

Video Chunks: For adaptive streaming, consider caching video chunks at the edge or using a CDN for faster delivery.

Expiration Policies: Implement expiration policies for cache entries to ensure that users receive updated metadata and content when changes occur.

Invalidation Mechanism: Implement mechanisms to invalidate or update cache entries when videos are added, modified, or removed.

User-Specific Caching: Consider caching user-specific data, such as recently watched videos, to enhance the user experience.

Remember that caching strategies can vary based on the specific requirements and scale of your video streaming platform. It's essential to monitor performance and adjust caching strategies accordingly.
