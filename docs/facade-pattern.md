"When you use a Laravel Facade like DB, it is typically a static proxy to an instance of the Illuminate\Database\Connection class. Laravel's service container manages the actual instances and allows you to switch database connections or mock them for testing."

Anology for non-technical person

Imagine you have a fancy robot chef in your kitchen. This robot chef can cook different types of meals for you. Now, this robot chef has a special menu card, and each dish on the menu requires a specific set of tools and ingredients.

Now, let's say you want to cook a pizza. You don't need to worry about gathering all the tools and ingredients yourself. Instead, you tell your personal assistant (the Laravel Facade) what you want, and your assistant takes care of getting the robot chef (the underlying service) ready for the job.

In our analogy:

The robot chef is like the underlying service or class that knows how to perform tasks (in Laravel, it's often a database connection class).
The menu card is like the methods provided by the service (e.g., methods to perform database queries).
Your personal assistant is like the Facade â€“ it acts as a go-between, making it easier for you to interact with the robot chef without worrying about the details.
So, when you use a Laravel Facade like DB::table('my_table')->get(), you're essentially telling your personal assistant (the Facade) to instruct the robot chef (the underlying database connection) to get some data from a table. The Facade simplifies the process and lets you focus on what you want to achieve rather than the nitty-gritty details of how it's done.
