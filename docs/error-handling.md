The decision of whether to use try-catch blocks inside methods or rely on a global error handler (such as error_handler.php) depends on the context and the type of errors you're handling. Here are some considerations:

Granularity of Error Handling:

Inside Methods: Use try-catch blocks within methods when you want to handle errors at a specific level of granularity. This allows you to respond differently to errors depending on the context in which they occur.
Global Handler: A global error handler can catch unhandled exceptions and errors globally, providing a centralized place for generic error handling.
Business Logic vs. Infrastructure Errors:

Inside Methods: Handle errors related to business logic, expected exceptions, or specific operations within individual methods. This provides more context-sensitive responses.
Global Handler: Use the global handler for infrastructure-level errors, unexpected exceptions, or as a fallback for any unhandled errors.
Consistency:

Inside Methods: Having try-catch blocks inside methods allows you to define specific error-handling logic for each operation. This can lead to more consistent and predictable behavior for specific operations.
Global Handler: A global handler provides a consistent way to handle errors that might be thrown from various parts of your application without duplicating error-handling code in every method.
Logging and Debugging:

Inside Methods: Logging and debugging information can be more detailed when handled within the method. You have access to the local context, variables, and the state of the application.
Global Handler: The global handler is useful for logging unexpected errors and providing a centralized place for logging, especially when you need to log errors consistently across the application.
Graceful Degradation:

Inside Methods: Implement retry mechanisms or fallback strategies within specific methods to gracefully degrade in the face of transient errors.
Global Handler: A global handler can catch errors and provide a generic response to the user, ensuring the application doesn't crash due to unhandled exceptions.
In summary, a combination of both try-catch blocks inside methods and a global error handler is often a good approach. Use try-catch blocks for specific, context-sensitive error handling, and rely on a global handler for catching unexpected errors or as a fallback for unhandled exceptions. This provides a balance between fine-grained control and consistency in error handling.
