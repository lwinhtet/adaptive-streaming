Certainly! Below is a Markdown documentation for your `migrate.php` script to be included in a README file:

# Migration Script (`migrate.php`)

The `migrate.php` script is an essential component of the PHP project, responsible for managing database migrations. This script utilizes the Core Migration, Schema, Utilities, and Database classes to facilitate smooth migration operations.

## Prerequisites

Before running the script, make sure you have the following prerequisites installed and configured:

- PHP environment
- Composer for managing dependencies
- [vlucas/phpdotenv](https://github.com/vlucas/phpdotenv) for loading environment variables
- Database configuration settings in `configs/databases.php`

## Usage

To execute the script, use the command line with the following format:

```bash
php migrate.php [operation] [migrationName]
```

### Operations:

- `--up`: Execute pending migrations
- `--down`: Rollback the last executed migration
- `--create [migrationName]`: Create a new migration file with the specified name

### Examples:

#### Execute pending migrations:

```bash
php migrate.php --up
```

#### Rollback the last executed migration:

```bash
php migrate.php --down
```

#### Create a new migration file:

```bash
php migrate.php --create MyNewMigration
```

## Configuration

The script reads environment variables from a `.env` file using the `vlucas/phpdotenv` package. Ensure that your database connection details are correctly configured in the `.env` file.

Certainly! Below is the section you can include in your README file to guide users on customizing their own `.env` file with their database and application information:

## Customizing Environment Variables

To use the `migrate.php` script in your local development environment, you need to set up your own `.env` file. Below is an example of a basic `.env` file with placeholders for your specific information:

```env
APP_ENV=development
APP_NAME=your-app-name

DB_CONNECTION=mysql
DB_HOST=your-db-host
DB_PORT=your-db-port
DB_DATABASE=your-db-name
DB_USERNAME=your-db-username
DB_PASSWORD=your-db-password
```

Replace the placeholder values (`your-app-name`, `your-db-host`, `your-db-port`, `your-db-name`, `your-db-username`, and `your-db-password`) with your actual application and database details.
